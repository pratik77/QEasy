# About this app - QEasy



So our best chances to stop the coronavirus spread is through social distancing and staying home. 

Due to the lockdown there has been restrictions in moving around freely which has led to longer queues and panic. The police are  also finding it difficult to handle the public. 

People with genuine reasons are also finding it difficult to step out due to the fear of getting harassed by police.

Local businesses like salons, cafes, gyms and other businesses are also incurring heavy losses due to the lockdown.

So we have come up with the QEasy to make Queues easy for you.

For the general public, who need to step out of their homes to buy essentials during the covid-19 lockdown, 

“QEasy” will provide an automated appointment , valid with in the boundaries of a particular distance and a time slot, thereby managing queues and ensuring social distancing. 

Enlisted merchants can also enable users to buy gift card for their services which can be used after Lockdown.

Our mission was to solve the problem of longer queues and panic within the general public. And find out a way to give local businesses to serve the public admist the lockdown also keeping their business afloat.


We have built a fully functional android app, which consists of 3 user types, Customer, merchants and police.

The rough idea of the app is to register users to book a slot with the enlisted shops, after which the user gets a generated QR code. This QR code can be scanned by the merchant post the billing at the selected time slot.

The police can also log in to scan this QR code to verify a user is authorised to move or not.

We have contacted  two local businesses from different cities who think enlisting their business with this app will help their business during this tough situation and have also talked about sharing it with other local businesses. We think during times like this citizens with standard pay can help the local business by doing their bit.

We feel that  our app will ensure queue management efficiently and  can bring some positivity and normalcy during these testing times.
